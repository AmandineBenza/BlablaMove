> Week 39 - 27/09/18

--- Brainstorm billing (points):

- Direct travel
- Travel with connection
- Needs to travel right now but don't have points (credit ?)

. To take in account (billing calculation):  
- Weight and space taken [to transport object caracteristics]
- Travel distance (fuel ?) 
	- Speed option computed on above parameters

> Billing after delivery
> Auctioning setup ? (enchÃ¨res)
> Date of expiration ?
---

--- Technologies && architecture ---

---
Mock: minimum, can be hardcoded
Base: minimal system
GO:   Full system

DB:   database
EP:   extern provider
---

. Minimum architecture for demonstration purposes.
. Focus on billing, mock/base rest

- Users management [Base] 				- DB 
	- Volume assessment ?			

- Road management  [Base]				- Computing + (DB + EP)
- Billing system   [GO]					- Computing
	- Object weight
	- Object size
	- Travel destination

- Insurance system [Mock]				- DB + computing ?
	+ broken ; goods not delivered
				- steal from transporter
				- steal from extern
	- Warnings
		- banishment
-  
- Web service for users [Front-end]
	- Billing computation... [Back-end]

- Language: Java
- Database: SQL Server
- Web service builder: Springboot
- Extern provider (map API) ?

- WEEK 39 :  ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)
(30/09/18)

>>>>> What was achieved this week ? 

- We defined use cases (Alice & Bob)
- We defined the services our API will provide to the users (Using Alice & Bob use cases)
- We have begun to talk about the architecture of our API and the technologies we will use.

>>>>> What is planned for the following week ?

- We will continue to think about our architectural and technological choices 
- We will planify our future objectives week by week 

>>>>> What are the blockers and risks ?

- One risk is that our Scope may not be well defined

- Week 38 : Choose a topic, build the teams ![#9BC09D](https://placehold.it/15/9BC09D/000000?text=+)
- Week 39 : Define Scope, users. Identify Risk area, investigations, define use cases ![#9BC09D](https://placehold.it/15/9BC09D/000000?text=+)
- Week 40 : General Architecture, technology choice, external interfaces ![#8B2E2E](https://placehold.it/15/8B2E2E/000000?text=+)
	- General Architecture : Will be in architecture.pdf
	- Technological Choices : Java, SpringBoot, SQL Server (JPA plugin)
	- External interfaces : ? 

- Week 41 : Component details, internal interfaces. Ext system mocked ![#8B2E2E](https://placehold.it/15/8B2E2E/000000?text=+) 
- Week 42 : Contiuous integration, Env. built, Walking Skeleton ![#F1C40F](https://placehold.it/15/F1C40F/000000?text=+)

- WEEK 40 & 41 :  ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)
(10/10/18)

>>>>> What was achieved this week ? 

- We have modified our use cases to focus more on billing (our part).
- We have defined a road map until the week 45 (POC).
- We have defined some technological choices and a architecture overview.

>>>>> What is planned for the following week ?

- As we say on our roadmap, we will start our implementation of BlaBlaMove.

>>>>> What are the blockers and risks ?

- We have not yet divided the work between us, so it must be done quickly.


- WEEK 42 : ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)
(16/10/18)

- Is BBM its own client or client of another company ?
